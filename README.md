# Semantic Argument Types in Persuasive Essays

This repo contains our annotations of semantic argument types for the Argument Annotated Essays (AAE) corpus (Stab & Gurevych 2017). 
In addition we provide the annotation guidelines. 
As we are not allowed to share the original component annotations from Stab & Gurevych 2017, these need to be reconstructed from our annotations and/or
the AAE corpus.
